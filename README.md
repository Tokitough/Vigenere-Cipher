# Vigenere-Cipher

### How Vigenere Cipher Works
You use a keyword as your key, which you then convert into the corresponding letter values between 0 and 25. Then, in order to encrypt it, write your message on one row (letters 0 to 25), consecutivelyÂ write the keyword below it, add each column, and take the result as a modulo of 26. The resulting numbers are the ciphertext.

## How to run the program
1. Think of a text and a keyword.
2. Input the text in all UPPERCASE with no spaces.
3. Input the keyword that will be used to change the order of the letter series.
4. Watch as the program produce a ciphertext and converts it again into plain text.
